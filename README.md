# Housing Price Prediction

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze housing data and build a predictive model that estimates house prices
based on property features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains structured housing data with numerical and categorical features related to property
characteristics and pricing.

## Approach
This project follows a standard data science workflow:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and preparation
- Regression model training
- Model evaluation

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Supervised regression modeling
- Model evaluation

## Results
The trained regression model captures key relationships between housing features and prices, demonstrating
the effectiveness of data-driven approaches for price estimation.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Notes
This project emphasizes data analysis, feature understanding, and model interpretation rather than complex modeling.
